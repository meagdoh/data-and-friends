**The Rules**
* Each player draws 3 cards to start the game.
* The Data Czar reads a prompt starting with "Tell me a story about [...]"
* The players choose 1 or more cards that tell a compelling story, and places in the middle.
* The Data Czar chooses the best card(s) and explains why.
* The winner collects the card to track score
... the Data Czar moves to the person to the left..
* Pick up the same number of cards you dealt in the last round
* Whoever has the most cards at the end wins!


**Example round**
"Tell me a story about [registered dogs in NYC]..."

Using the data set and available graphs from [databasic.io](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/results/59cdd3907088b42cdeca5fbf), here are a few responses:

* 1) 1,200 dogs in NYC are named Bella.
* 2) 45% (50,761 out of 111,642) of registered dogs in NYC are female.
* 3) Adjusting for population in each borough, Bronx has the highest number of registered dogs.

Based on the complexity and strength of the statement, the best story is #3

Why? Here's a potential breakdown:

* 1) 1,200 dogs in NYC are named Bella.
> Rating: Low. This data is directly presented and does not tell a story about all dogs.

* 2) 45% (50,761 out of 111,642) of registered dogs in NYC are female.
> Rating: Medium. Comparison data shows the difference between two groups

* 3) Adjusting for population in each borough, Bronx has the highest number of registered dogs.
> Rating: High. This statement acknowledges a limitation, accounts for that, and redresses a data point.
