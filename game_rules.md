* Whoever has the most cards at the end wins!


<h2> example round of play </h2>
"Tell me a story about [registered dogs in NYC]..."

Using the data set and available graphs from [databasic.io](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/results/59cdd3907088b42cdeca5fbf), here are a few responses:

* **1,200 dogs in NYC are named Bella.**
* **45% (50,761 out of 111,642) of registered dogs in NYC are female.**
* **Adjusting for population in each borough, Bronx has the highest number of registered dogs.**

Based on the complexity and strength of the statement, the best story is #3

Why? Here's a potential breakdown:

* **1,200 dogs in NYC are named Bella.**
> Rating: Low. This data is directly presented and does not tell a story about all dogs.

* **45% (50,761 out of 111,642) of registered dogs in NYC are female.**
> Rating: Medium. Comparison data shows the difference between two groups

* **Adjusting for population in each borough, Bronx has the highest number of registered dogs.**
> Rating: High. This statement acknowledges a limitation, accounts for that, and redresses a data point.
